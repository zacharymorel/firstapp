SCOPE N Variables
1. "Shadowing" is the term where the compiler uses the whatever variable is defined within the current scope of the reference (we can redecalre global variables within a smaller scope).
2. Uppercase variables at the package level can be accessed by any other packages importing that package (Globally visible).
3. Lowercase variables can only be accessed within the current package.
4. Block scope is established by functions. Any variable defined within that scope can only be accessed within that current scope. 
5. Naming conventions: length of the variable is defined by how long it will be used (a forloop would have short variable names)
6. Acronyms should be ALL UPPERCASE.
7. Go does not do a implicit type conversion. 

Strings
8. Strings are just an alias for a stream of bites.
